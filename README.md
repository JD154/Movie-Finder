## Why I made this project?

I made this project in order to know how connect Vue.js frontend with Node.js server and make API requests. Also to improve skills in:

#### Frontend

* Create a Proxy and service to connect server.
* Conditional showing using booleans.
* Emit props events from child to parent.
* Vue Transitions with css.

#### Backend:

* Send and receive data from server.
* Error manipulation from server.
* Async and Await javascript functions.
* Deploy repo to heroku with auto-build in deploy.

## Running local

You will be able to run locally with those simple commands.

Install npm modules

```
npm install
```

Run server

```
npm run server
```

And finally run frontend

```
npm run serve
```
You need to keep alive server and frontend jobs in order to make searches.
